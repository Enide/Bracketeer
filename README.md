Overview
--------

Bracketeer is a platform used to enrich the editors in Eclipse.
#### Features:

- Coloring the brackets surrounding the cursor & brackets which have no match.
- Adding comment on brackets closing loops, functions, etc...
- Highly customizable.

#### Current supported editors:

- JDT (java) 
- CDT (C/C++).

Installation 
------------
In you Eclipse, go to: Help->Install new software...  
Enter: **http://chookapp.github.com/ChookappUpdateSite/**  
From the chookapp category, choose any Bracketeer editor support you want (CDT - for C/C++, JDT - for java, etc...).  
For example, choosing "Bracketeer CDT support" will install the Bracketeer infrastructure (if not already installed) and the CDT editor support. *It is not advised to install a Bracketeer support for an editor type which is not already installed in your Eclipse (although it shouldn't do any actual harm)*.

Enjoy.
